This project features an AI that has learned to understand human emotions. it has done this by interpreting the hashtags people leave on social media platforms, a popular human method of categorizing images. 

In this code you will find a trained emotional model based on the hashtags which can be repurposed for whatever you require. There is also a linked webapp which builds an interface to categorize unseen images. This can also serve to train the model further if desired.
